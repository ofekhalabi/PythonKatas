To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that cannot be divided by any other numbers except 1 and itself. 

Examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.
 
A number is **not prime** if it can be divided evenly by another number (other than 1 and itself).
