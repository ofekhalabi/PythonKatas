"""
To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Implement the 'time_me' function to measure the average execution time of a given function over 10 runs.


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
The `time` module provides various time-related functions.
`time.time()` returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch. 
By calculating the difference between the start and end times, you can measure how long a function takes to execute.
